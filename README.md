# Noemi's Vinyl collection

I've been wanting to list my vinyls in some way for quite a while now and it just seemed to suit this flexbox-excercise.

## The problem

The flexbox-model worked out quite well i guess. For the phone screen it's still quite small and i'm not quite happy with the design yet. I'll work more on that. The website I published through netlify took a while to load all pictures, but I think I could work that out by scaling down the sizes of the images.
I also wanted to include a linked overview (A-Z) so I can jump directly to artists in the end of the alphabet. I could solve this by linking the letters A-Z to the referring flex-box-child. It turned out like I imagined it, but not sure if this is the easiest and clearest way to go. I wish I could include a linked box to the top of the website, that is fixed to the site even when scrolling, but couldn't make that work.
What I also wanted to try out was a hovering effect. So that when the curser hovers over the album cover, the artist and albumtitle turn up. But I couldn't figure that out. It destroyed the whole flexbox-style I've been working on for quite a while, so I deleted it again:)
